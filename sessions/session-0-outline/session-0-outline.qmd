## What is R?

R is a *statistical* computing language. Used for data manipulation, data analysis and graphical display. Importantly R is free and open source software (FOSS) which means it is accessible to all. 

## Why choose R?

- Longevity: R is a stable language with a strong emphasis on maintaining backward compatibility. 
- Data structures are native to the language.
- Built-in graphics capabilities.
- Extensibility: Users can create their own functions and packages, making R highly customizable.
- Makes you think in terms of a workflow which is: repeatable to other cases; reproducible; and easy to maintain.
- Has many uses: data analysis; data visualisation; dashboards; interactive reporting; automated pipelines.
- Active and helpful community.
- Transferable skill.
- Productivity - reproducible and automatable pipelines can lead to more time being spent on other areas.
